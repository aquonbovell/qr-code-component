## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Block Element Modifier (BEM)

### What I learned

I learned how to use css properties globally and locally, which aid in maintaining the project and future ones.

### Useful resources

- [Block Element Modifier](http://getbem.com/naming/) - This helped me for creating better classes. I really liked how they used the nesting of elements taking advantage of the cascade in css.
